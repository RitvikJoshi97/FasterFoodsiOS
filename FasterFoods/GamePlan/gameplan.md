Managing **diabetes and PCOD** as a vegetarian requires a routine that prioritizes **stable insulin**, **high protein**, and **consistent daily habits**. Focus your meals around **40% vegetables, 30% protein, 20% slow carbs, 10% healthy fats**, and avoid sugars, refined carbs, and high-GI fruits. Eat every **3.5–4 hours**, walk **after dinner**, and maintain a sleep schedule to keep hormones regulated. Remember: **this Game Plan adapts over time** — FasterFoods updates your recommendations as it learns your habits and incorporates the latest research. Track your meals in FasterFoods daily so the system can adjust your nutrition strategy automatically. 

For workouts, prioritize **strength training 3–4×/week**, because it’s the most effective tool for insulin resistance and PCOD. Add **LISS walking 30–45 min** most days, sprinkle in light **HIIT 1–2×/week** (optional), and use **yoga/mobility** to manage cortisol. Keep your routine consistent, not extreme. Use the FasterFoods **Workout Tracker** to log sets, reps, and weekly progress — consistency matters more than intensity, and the app helps you stay on track.

Finally, support your nutrition with smart shopping and habit-building. Stock up on **paneer, tofu, dal, soya, leafy greens, low-GI fruits, ragi, oats, nuts, seeds, olive oil**, and minimize packaged foods. Use FasterFoods’ **Shopping List** and **Pantry** to organize weekly ingredients and avoid impulsive, high-carb eating. Track weight, waist, fasting glucose, and energy **once per week**, not daily. With stable routines, balanced meals, and steady training, your body will gradually shift toward better insulin control, hormone balance, and sustainable fat loss.
