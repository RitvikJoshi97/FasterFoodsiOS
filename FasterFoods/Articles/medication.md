Pharmacological medications are a cornerstone in the management of **blood pressure (BP)**, particularly in individuals who cannot achieve target levels through lifestyle modifications alone. The major classes of antihypertensive drugs include diuretics, ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers and others, each targeting different physiological pathways of BP regulation. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

These medications work via distinct mechanisms: diuretics reduce blood volume by promoting sodium and water excretion; ACE-Is and ARBs block the Renin‑Angiotensin‑Aldosterone System (RAAS) thereby reducing vasoconstriction and volume expansion; CCBs relax arterial smooth muscle by inhibiting calcium influx; beta-blockers reduce heart rate and contractility and blunt sympathetic activity. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Clinical guidelines emphasize timely initiation and often combination therapy to achieve BP targets and reduce cardiovascular risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends monotherapy or dual-therapy depending on baseline BP and patient risk factors, noting that uncontrolled hypertension persists in many patients despite treatment. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} Effective BP lowering through these drugs correlates with reductions in stroke, myocardial infarction and heart‐failure incidence. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

In summary: while medications do not replace healthy lifestyle behaviours (diet, exercise, sleep etc.), they are essential when BP remains elevated. Choosing the **appropriate class**, **dose**, monitoring for **side effects** and **adherence** are critical for optimal results. Key papers include guideline overviews and pharmacotherapy reviews in essential hypertension. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
