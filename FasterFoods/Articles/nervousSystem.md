The balance of the **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**—specifically between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches—plays a foundational role in **blood-pressure regulation** by modulating heart rate, vascular tone, and cardiac output. Short-term mechanisms such as the baroreflex rapidly adjust ANS activity in response to arterial pressure changes, thereby influencing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

In people with elevated or sustained high blood pressure (hypertension), evidence shows **increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity** and **reduced parasympathetic (vagal) tone**. This autonomic imbalance contributes to persistent vasoconstriction, higher heart rate, and altered renal-vascular regulation—key features of the hypertensive state. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

At the organ-system level, heightened SNS output affects the heart (↑ contractility, ↑ rate), blood vessels (↑ constriction → ↑ resistance), and kidneys (↑ sodium/water retention via increased renal sympathetic signaling) — all of which drive higher arterial pressure and reduce baroreflex efficacy. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

Therefore, strategies that **improve autonomic balance** (e.g., enhancing vagal tone via aerobic exercise, stress-management, improving sleep, or even targeted therapies like renal denervation in resistant cases) can support healthy blood-pressure control. Key studies cover autonomic dysfunction in hypertension and newer interventional approaches targeting the ANS. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
