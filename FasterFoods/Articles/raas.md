The Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System (RAAS) is a central regulator of **blood-pressure** through controlling **blood volume**, sodium/water retention and **vascular tone**. When renal perfusion drops or sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule decreases, the kidneys release renin, which triggers angiotensinogen → angiotensin I → angiotensin II; angiotensin II constricts vessels and stimulates aldosterone secretion, leading to sodium and water retention and elevated pressure. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   
In its classical pathway, angiotensin II via AT₁ receptors increases systemic vascular resistance, promotes sympathetic activity, enhances sodium reabsorption, and drives aldosterone‐mediated volume expansion—and these mechanisms together raise arterial pressure both acutely and chronically. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
   
Recent research emphasises that besides the classical arm (↑ pressure), RAAS also has **alternative pathways** (e.g., angiotensin 1-7/ACE2/Mas receptor axis) that promote vasodilation, increased nitric oxide and anti-inflammatory effects, providing a counterbalance to the hypertensive drive. Disruption of this balance contributes to hypertension. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
   
Clinically, RAAS overactivation is a key target for blood-pressure control: drugs such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs and direct renin inhibitors inhibit this system, lowering both vascular resistance and volume load. Thus understanding RAAS dynamics helps inform hypertension treatment and risk management. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
