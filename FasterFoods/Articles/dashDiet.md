The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a dietary pattern designed to **lower blood pressure** by emphasising fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, lean protein, low-fat dairy and limiting saturated fat, red meat, added sugars and sodium. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   
Clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that adopting the DASH diet leads to meaningful reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. For example, a meta-analysis of 30 RCTs found average reductions of ~-3.2 mmHg systolic and ~-2.5 mmHg diastolic compared to control diets. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
   
The blood-pressure-lowering effect is **enhanced** when the DASH diet is combined with reduced sodium intake (e.g., ≤ 2300 mg or even ~1500 mg daily). In the landmark DASH‑Sodium trial the greatest drop in blood pressure occurred in subjects on the DASH diet with the lowest sodium intake. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
   
In summary: the DASH diet is a **key lifestyle intervention** for blood pressure and cardiovascular health — emphasising nutrient-rich foods, limiting sodium/processed foods, and sustainable eating. Guidelines widely recommend it. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
