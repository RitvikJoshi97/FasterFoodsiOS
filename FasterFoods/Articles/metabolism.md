Excess body fat—particularly abdominal or visceral obesity—and poor **metabolic health** (insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, inflammation) contribute significantly to elevated **blood pressure** by altering haemodynamics, renal-sodium handling and neurohormonal regulation. In cohort studies such as the one summarising obesity‐related hypertension, adiposity accounted for ~26-28% of new hypertension cases. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Mechanistically, obesity drives increased **sympathetic nervous system activation**, up-regulated Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System (RAAS) activity, higher sodium and water retention, and endothelial dysfunction—altogether raising peripheral resistance and volume load. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} At the same time, metabolic dysfunction (insulin resistance, adipokine dysregulation) worsens vascular tone and renal impairment. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Even individuals classified as “metabolically healthy obese” (MHO) are at increased risk of **pre-hypertension and hypertension** compared with metabolically healthy lean counterparts—especially when abdominal adiposity is present. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} This suggests that adiposity per se has adverse BP implications, albeit modifying risk via metabolic status and fat distribution.

In summary: targeting **weight reduction**, improving metabolic health (insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, inflammation), and reducing visceral fat are foundational strategies for **blood pressure control** in obesity-linked hypertension. Key review papers include the pathophysiology overview by Shariq et al. (2020) and the metabolically healthy obesity versus hypertension risk studies. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
