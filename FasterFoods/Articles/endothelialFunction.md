The inner lining of our blood vessels—the **vascular endothelium**—is vital for **blood pressure regulation**, largely via the production of **Nitric Oxide (NO)** by the enzyme Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS). NO diffuses into vascular smooth muscle, triggering cGMP-mediated relaxation and thereby reducing vascular resistance and helping maintain healthy **arterial pressure**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

When endothelial function is compromised—termed **endothelial dysfunction**—NO bioavailability falls, vasodilatory capacity weakens, and vessels shift toward **vasoconstriction, inflammation and thrombosis**, all of which raise **peripheral resistance** and elevate blood pressure. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} In human studies, genetic or pharmacologic reduction of NO signalling has been shown to increase mean arterial pressure by ~30 mmHg. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Mechanistically, oxidative stress or eNOS “uncoupling” (where eNOS produces superoxide instead of NO) reduces NO output and augments vascular stiffness, arterial remodelling and heightened **vascular tone**—core features of hypertension development. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} Nutritional and lifestyle factors (e.g., dietary nitrates, high shear stress from exercise) can enhance NO bioavailability and thus improve endothelial-mediated vasodilation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

In summary: maintaining **endothelial health** and **NO bioavailability** is a foundational strategy for supporting healthy blood pressure. Dysfunction in this system is both a contributor to and early marker for hypertension and cardiovascular risk. Key papers include reviews on NO in hypertension, eNOS dysfunction mechanisms, and interventions improving NO signalling. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
