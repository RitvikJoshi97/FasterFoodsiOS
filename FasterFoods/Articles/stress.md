The interplay between **stress** and **hormonal regulation** plays a crucial role in influencing **blood pressure** by activating the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal axis (HPA) and the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS). Acute stress triggers the release of catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline) and glucocorticoids (cortisol), which increase heart rate, vasoconstriction, and cardiac output—raising arterial pressure. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

Chronic or repeated stress can lead to maladaptive hormonal responses: sustained elevated cortisol, altered HPA feedback, and heightened SNS tone can promote long-term hypertension. For example, higher urinary stress hormone levels have been linked to increased incidence of hypertension in multi-ethnic cohorts. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

At the renal and vascular level, hormones produced during stress influence fluid balance and vascular tone: cortisol and catecholamines boost sodium retention, increase blood volume, reduce baroreflex sensitivity, and promote arterial stiffness—all contributing to elevated blood pressure. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

In summary, managing **psychosocial stress** is a key lifestyle component for healthy blood pressure regulation—techniques such as mindfulness, social support, and autonomic-balance training help moderate HPA/SNS activation. Prominent papers include Chopra et al. (2011) on neuro-endocrine BP regulation, Tsai et al. (2024) on stress hormones and CV risk, and the Kazakou et al. (2023) review of stress-system hormonal regulators. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
