Regular physical exercise supports **cardiovascular health** and helps regulate **blood pressure** by strengthening the heart, enhancing vascular function, and reducing systemic resistance. For instance, meta-analyses show that aerobic training lowers systolic pressure by about −3.84 mmHg and diastolic by −2.58 mmHg in adults. [Meta-Analysis 2002][1] :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Mechanistically, exercise improves endothelial function (↑ nitric oxide), reduces sympathetic nervous system activity, and increases arterial compliance — all contributing to lower peripheral vascular resistance and thus lower resting blood pressure. [Cardio Effects Review][2] :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

For people with hypertension or “resistant” blood pressure, structured exercise (aerobic, resistance, or combined) serves as an effective non-pharmacological intervention. A review highlights that exercise training is endorsed by major guidelines for BP management. [Exercise Hypertension Review][3] :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

In summary: incorporating **regular moderate to vigorous exercise** (e.g., ≥150 minutes/week of aerobic activity or equivalent) into your routine is a powerful way to support healthy blood pressure and cardiovascular risk reduction. Key papers include meta-analyses on aerobic training, mechanistic reviews on vascular adaptation, and guideline-driven lifestyle intervention studies.
