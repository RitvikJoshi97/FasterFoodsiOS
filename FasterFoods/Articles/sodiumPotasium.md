The balance between **sodium** and **potassium** intake plays a pivotal role in **blood pressure regulation** by influencing fluid volume, vascular tone, and renal handling of electrolytes. High sodium intake promotes fluid retention and increased vascular resistance, while potassium supports sodium excretion (natriuresis) and relaxes blood vessel walls [CDC Key Points][9].  
  
Research indicates that the **sodium-to-potassium (Na:K) ratio** is more strongly associated with blood pressure outcomes than sodium or potassium alone — randomized controlled trials and observational studies alike show lower blood pressure when the ratio is reduced (i.e., less sodium relative to potassium) [Systematic Review 2014][1], [Observational Cohort 2023][11].  
  
Dietary trials show that lowering sodium intake and increasing potassium intake together produces meaningful reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, particularly in individuals with hypertension [Low Sodium/High Potassium Review 2023][3]. Potassium supplementation alone in hypertensive subjects reduced systolic pressure by ~6.8 mmHg and diastolic by ~4.6 mmHg in meta-analysis [Potassium Supplementation RCT][12].  
  
In summary, while reducing sodium is important, **increasing potassium intake** and lowering the Na:K ratio offer a more powerful strategy for blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk reduction. Key studies that support this include the DASH-style dietary trials, meta-analyses of potassium supplementation, and prospective cohorts linking Na:K ratio to incident hypertension and CVD [Dietary Na:K Ratio Review][8].
