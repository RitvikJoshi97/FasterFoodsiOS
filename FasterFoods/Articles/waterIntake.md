Adequate water intake plays a key role in **blood pressure regulation** by maintaining *blood volume* and enabling optimal cardiovascular function. When you’re well-hydrated, your blood vessels remain flexible and your kidneys efficiently excrete sodium and waste, helping to keep your **arterial pressure** stable. For example, a 12-week intervention where participants increased their water intake showed a reduction in blood pressure and improvements in markers like hematocrit and BUN [MDPI, 2020][1].

On the flip side, **dehydration** can trigger physiological stress that elevates blood pressure: reduced blood volume, increased secretion of vasopressin (which causes vasoconstriction), and impaired renal function all contribute to raised arterial tension [Healthline, 2024][2]. Observational data support this: in a large cohort of Chinese adults, those drinking ≥6 cups of plain water per day had a significantly lower risk of developing hypertension compared to those drinking ≤1 cup [Frontiers in Public Health, 2023][3].

However, it’s not simply a case of “more is always better” when it comes to water intake and blood pressure. One randomized study found that in healthy young adults, **doubling** water intake (an extra ~2 L/day) **increased** daytime mean arterial pressure by about 2.4 mmHg over two weeks [PubMed, 2010][4]. That suggests water intake must be balanced with context (kidney health, sodium intake, cardiovascular status) and that excessive fluid intake may raise rather than lower pressure.

In short, while maintaining **adequate hydration** is a valuable lifestyle component for supporting healthy blood pressure, it should be combined with other habitual measures (limiting excess sodium, maintaining activity, managing weight). Key relevant studies include: the RCT by Nakamura et al. (2020) on increased water intake and BP reduction, the large cohort study by Li et al. (2024) on plain water intake and hypertension risk, and the acute trial showing raised BP with large fluid increase [PubMed, 2020][5].
